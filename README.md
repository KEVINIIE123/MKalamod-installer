# MKalamod installer
 Installer for the minecraft modpack [MKalamod](https://github.com/KEVINIIE123/MKalamod)

# Is this a virus?
For some reason, some anticheats flag it as a virus, but you can run the application manually.
I used [this BAT-to-EXE converter](https://bat-to-exe-converter-x64.en.softonic.com/) to put all the files into one .exe.

# How to run the program manually
1. Download the .zip
2. Unzip the file
3. Run the "install.bat"
