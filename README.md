# MKalamod installer
 Installer for the minecraft modpack [MKalamod](https://github.com/KEVINIIE123/MKalamod)

# Is this a virus?
For some reason, some antiviruses flag it as a virus, but you can [run the application manually](https://github.com/KEVINIIE123/MKalamod-installer?tab=readme-ov-file#manually-less-stable-builds)

I used [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) SFX to put all the files into one .exe.

# Troubleshooting
Windows says it's a virus! It is not. You can disable your antivirus or [run the program manually.](https://github.com/KEVINIIE123/MKalamod-installer?tab=readme-ov-file#manually-less-stable-builds)

It doesn't work! Open a ticket on our [discord server.](https://discord.gg/dkJDcMDz6T)
